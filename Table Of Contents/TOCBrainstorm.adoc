== Brainstorm
This is meant as a place to start forming together a OSS Pedagogy... a listing of high level topics and subtopics for the curriculum to focus on.

=== Title of project
Should it even be CURRICULUM?, which refers to whole years of study mapped out. Are we necessarily mapping out a course of study? Possibly some will reference it for this, but many will not. Curriculum still seems to get across the general purpose and it is differentiable from other stuff out there.

 * oss-curriculum
 * OSS Coursework
 * Teaching open source repository
 * Teaching open source resources

== TODOs

 * Database for activities / exercizes - no doubt that these eventually need to go into a database and be referenced by other material; the need for users to interact, rate, leave comments on each activity is vital; We will want to reference the same activities in multiple sections; Users may want to sort activities by type, difficulty, etc

 * Consider Jim Jagielski's Governance document (OSAS home.corp)

 * Blogging - How essentual is this? Asks OSAS list...
